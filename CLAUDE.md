## Project Overview

This project applies **formal graph theory to self-referential systems** (Wikipedia, databases, code) to discover hidden structure through deterministic traversal rules. The core insight: finite self-referential graphs partition into "basins of attraction" under deterministic rules, and switching between rules ("tunneling") reveals semantic relationships invisible to single-rule analysis.

**Current Focus**: Extracting and analyzing Wikipedia's link graph to validate N-Link Rule Theory empirically.

## **CRITICAL**: This `claude.md` is a different from the usual. 

This project maintains its own context documentation and propagation system designed to fill the same role as `claude.md` in normal usage and more. Rather than duplicate and maintain the information in multiple places, you should use the internal documentation system 

Please begin each session by reading [llm-facing-documentation/README.md](llm-facing-documentation/README.md) and follow its instructions as if they are part of the `claude.md` system.
