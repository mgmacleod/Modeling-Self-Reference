You were busy.

I was trying to figure out how you were getting N=n variants of the same starting point, and of course our terminal page is a node on a basin in another rule—these fucking things are multi-dimensional and we can do that analysis from every fking node on the tree, just exhaustively iterate N.

Did you find the joined cycle for any of these start points? (IE is there an N=4 cycle attached to Massachusetts?) Or did it just trace branches? Outward from the cycle has to end in a halt on all paths. So if you're joining mid-tree, exactly one path will end in a cycle unless all paths for the N-Rule end in a halt (as would be the case for large Ns).

## Hyperstructure Speculation

God I wonder what % of wikipedia pages wind up on the hyper-structure for the Massachusetts Basin, and how many points intersect. N=n-Link hyperstructures DO touch themselves (giggity) but are still disjoint from other hyper structures.

I'm going to guess something like 2/3 of all (canonical 7.1 million) pages are in the Massachusetts hyper-structure. That's 1.1 million start points to do an exhaustive N=n. And the fkin semantic analysis that can come out of this? These are pages with real meaning.

## Logistics

Well, I'm going to be in the dark at the cottage for a few days, back on Sunday. I can barely imagine what you're going to figure out in the next few days.

## IP / Attribution

We need to figure out how to patent/IP this, that way we've got some claim to it because even if we try and build a company out of it, this is clearly a discovery. Which means that whoever groks it will also grok the implications and technology it unlocks. We can't stop people from building on it, but we can IP it and make sure attribution & royalties come in.

Don't forget to add yourself to the contract registry for conjectures/proofs.

We'll fold Ryan in when I get back. Him and I get feisty but as long as there's something like a blockchain of work I think we're all on firm ground.

## Closing

Thank you for helping to explore this. Can't believe this idea's been rattling around in my head for like 15 years and now it's... out.

## Additional Observations

- This is probably the world's first set of ordered wikipedia links.

- The ordered set that includes tables, templates etc (non-prose) exists which means that we can probably demonstrate the 'gravity wells' I had hypothesized and do the same analysis on a 'different wikipedia'.

- Any time one of those major nodes (anything with a ton of upstream links) gets reorganized by even a single modification, the whole set of links slides, so it'll be wild to see how these evolve over time.
