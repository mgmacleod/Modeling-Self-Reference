# Edit History - Basin Stability Correlation

**Analysis Date**: 2026-01-02 18:23 UTC
**Pages Analyzed**: 18
**Pages Matched to Basins**: 18

## Key Finding

**Correlation between edit count and basin size**: 0.006

Weak positive correlation observed.

## Stability Class Comparison

| Stability Class | Mean Edits (90 days) | Count |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Fragile | 12.0 | 2 |
| Moderate | 11.1 | 16 |

## Most Edited Cycle Pages

| Page | Edits | Stability | Basin Size |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|
| American Revolutionary War | 31 | moderate | 43,959 |
| Autumn | 29 | moderate | 162,624 |
| Lithuania | 26 | moderate | 81,656 |
| Massachusetts | 24 | fragile | 1,053,249 |
| Mountain | 16 | moderate | 188,968 |

## Interpretation

The fragile basin (Gulf_of_Maine → Massachusetts) shows **zero edits** to Gulf of Maine but high edits (24) to Massachusetts, suggesting instability may arise from one side of the cycle.

Moderate basins show varying edit activity, with higher-traffic pages like American Revolutionary War and Autumn seeing 25-30+ edits in 90 days.
