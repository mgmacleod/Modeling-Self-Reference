This project uses a self-referential directory management and documentation system designed to be LLM facing.

To initialize the LLM session, start by loading the README.md file in "llm-facing-documentation". It contains instructions to the llm about how to bootstrap, and emphasizes minimum context-loading with as-needed, when-needed protocols.

To initialize yourself, begin with human-facing-documentation!
